Once there was a woodcutter. One day he went to the forest to cut wood. He chose a tree on 
the bank of a river and started cutting it. Suddenly his axe slipped from his hand. 
And it fell into the river. The woodcutter was very sad. The river was deep and the current was strong. “what  will I do now?”
Said the woodcutter. ”I’ve lost my axe. I cannot buy another.”He started crying.
Then he heard a voice behind him. ”don’t cry,” said the voice.
